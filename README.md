<H2>PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group</H2>

The terminology that is used in the Linked Data domain consists of many specialized terms, abbreviations and acronyms that makes it hard for persons new to Linked Data to understand what Linked Data is about and what you can do with it to overcome data integration barriers (the data silo problem). 

There is large communication gap (<em>semantic gap</em>) between Linked Data experts and non-experts that the <strong>PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group</strong> would like to solve via a new and up-to-date <strong>PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus</strong> that defines 30% of the Linked Data terms that we use 90% of the time (a minimal set of the most relevant terms). Not only will each term have a short, clear and concise definition, it will also have references to existing definitions in DBpedia and Wikidata and it will have references to additional information from authorative sources like W3C, the Dutch Standardization Forum, etc. And the Linked Data Thesaurus will also have a hierarchical and thematic structure that would make terms, abbreviations and acronyms as accessible and findable as possible.

No Linked Data vocabulary stand on its own, it is usually linked to other internal and external vocabularies and datasets to maximize data re-use and to realize a more <em>modular structure</em>, where the needed modeling constructs are defined <em>only once</em> (and re-used many times). This means that we will also create a <strong>PLDN Community Ontology</strong> that defines the <em>persons</em>, <em>organizations</em> and <em>activities</em> of PLDN and a <strong>PLDN Publication Ontology</strong> that defines the <em>deliverables</em> of PLDN. Both ontologies will be lightweight ontologies, where we will only show the modelling constructs that we need in combination with the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus and the first versions of these ontologies will be based upon current <em>OWL-based</em> practices (<em>SHACL-based</em> versions might be added in the future).
